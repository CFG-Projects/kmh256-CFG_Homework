# Homework: Lesson 9 – Unit Testing
# Question 1
# Use Simple ATM program (previous homework) to write unit tests for your functions.
# You are allowed to re-factor your function to ‘untangle’ some logic into smaller blocks of code to 
# make it easier to write tests. 
# Try to write at least 5 unit tests in total covering various cases.

# import unittest
# import homework_exception_handling

# class TestHomeworkExceptionHandling(unittest.TestCase):

#     def test_account_balance(self):
#         print()
